Overview
========

This is a simple single-balanced mixer for the HF frquency range (around
7 MHz). The design is a switching mixer, so the local oscilator (LO) is a 
digital signal.  

The RF input should be biased based on the desired transconductance.
Expected bias is around 0.8 volts.

A differential is provided.  So the output should be the difference of
IFOUT_P and IFOUT_N.
