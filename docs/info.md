Overview
========

This is a simple single-balanced RF mixer for the HF frquency range (around
7 MHz). The design is a switching mixer, so the local oscilator (LO) is a 
digital signal.  

The RF input should be DC biased. Expected bias is around 0.6 volts.

A differential IF output is provided.  So the output should be the difference of
IFOUT_P and IFOUT_N.

The basic theory is provided [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_mixer).
